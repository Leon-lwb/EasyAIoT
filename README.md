</p>

#### 🧠 AI Capabilities

<ul style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #444; margin: 10px 0;">
  <li><strong>YOLO26 Next-Generation Object Detection</strong>: Built-in next-generation object detection, ready out of the box for real-time feed analysis and snapshot recognition. On the same hardware, connect more camera streams with faster response and fewer false alarms. Supports the full loop from data collection, annotation, and training to deployment and inference—helping users iteratively build custom detection models at lower cost and quickly cover common security and industrial scenarios such as hard hat compliance, unauthorized entry, and fire hazards, making "see accurately, compute fast, scale easily" the default capability</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-Protocol Camera Access Support</strong>: Comprehensive support for GB28181 and ONVIF, two mainstream video surveillance protocols, enabling standardized device access and management. GB28181, as China's national standard, perfectly adapts to mainstream domestic surveillance equipment; ONVIF, as an international universal standard, is widely compatible with global mainstream camera brands. Through dual-protocol support, the platform seamlessly integrates with existing surveillance systems, achieving plug-and-play device access, automatic discovery, and unified management, significantly reducing device access barriers, enhancing system compatibility and scalability, and providing a solid technical foundation for large-scale camera deployment. In addition, NVR batch scan, registration, and unified management across same-segment and cross-segment networks are supported, covering mainstream brands including Hikvision, Dahua, Huawei, Ezviz, and Xiaomi, with native-protocol subnet discovery, one-click registration, and batch channel import, further reducing the cost of large-scale surveillance device onboarding and operations</li>
  <li><strong>Tianditu Spatial Visualization & Map-Based Analysis</strong>: Integrated with China's national Tianditu map service, the platform brings cameras, alerts, and person/vehicle recognition onto a single map—upgrading surveillance from "watching feeds" to "seeing the big picture." Both the streaming media and alert modules offer a "Map Distribution" view with a device directory tree for regional focus, giving instant visibility into checkpoint layout and online status. Map click-to-pin, location search, and batch coordinate import help GB channels, NVR channels, and direct-connect cameras get mapped quickly so every feed has clear spatial context. Alerts are automatically placed on the map via linked camera coordinates; filter by time, event type, task, and business tags, then open snapshots and recordings in one click—helping operators move fast from "where did it happen" to action. Combined with face and plate libraries, hits across multiple sites can be woven into spatial trails—<strong>trace by person</strong> to reconstruct movement and presence within a monitored area; <strong>trace by vehicle</strong> to link passing records and pinpoint routes and stop zones for find-person/find-vehicle, patrol deployment, and post-incident review. Mobile devices also support track playback to replay patrol and travel paths on a timeline. Switch freely between vector and satellite basemaps with auto-fit view, so managers use the map as the anchor to spot anomalies, lock onto targets, and coordinate response faster</li>
  <li><strong>Dify Agent Orchestration Integration</strong>: Integrated with the open-source LLM application platform Dify, providing visual workflow orchestration, Agent building, knowledge-base RAG retrieval augmentation, and publishing of conversational and tool-type applications. Dify can be deployed in one click via the middleware installation script with automatic initialization. Deeply integrated with the GPUStack compute layer, it seamlessly connects deployed Qwen, DeepSeek, and other large language models as model providers into agent pipelines, enabling business users to rapidly build industry intelligent applications for scenarios such as security patrol, incident analysis, and operations Q&A—significantly accelerating the journey from model deployment to production</li>
  <li><strong>Qwen / DeepSeek Multi-GPU Deployment</strong>: Supports deploying Qwen, DeepSeek, and other large language models across multiple GPUs in parallel.

Supports multi-dimensional data visualization, achieving unified monitoring and management of cloud, edge, and device layers, providing decision-makers with a global perspective intelligent monitoring command center</li>
  <li><strong>Face Recognition and Face Library Management</strong>: Supports flexibly enabling face recognition in camera tasks. Built on Milvus for face library and facial feature vector management, it provides create/query/update/delete capabilities for face samples and feature vectors, as well as high-performance vector retrieval. It supports efficient face comparison and identity retrieval on captured frames, while fully recording match results, snapshots, camera location information, and device context for personnel trajectory tracing, security forensics, and multidimensional statistical analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>License Plate Recognition and Plate Library Management</strong>: Enable license plate recognition in monitoring tasks with one click. Automatically reads plate information from passing vehicles and compares against your own plate libraries in real time. Flexibly maintain whitelists, blacklists, and business tags; trigger instant alerts when vehicles match rules—supporting access control at entrances and exits, targeted vehicle watchlists, and visitor vs. registered vehicle management. Automatically registers newly seen plates and keeps complete capture and match records for post-incident lookups, trace verification, and evidence retention. Recognition runs in parallel with existing video analytics without affecting monitoring and alert stability or real-time performance</li>
  <li><strong>Device Detection Region Drawing</strong>: Provides a visual device detection region drawing tool that supports drawing rectangular and polygonal detection regions on device snapshot images, supports flexible association configuration between regions and algorithm models, supports visual management, editing, and deletion of regions, supports keyboard shortcuts to improve drawing efficiency, enabling precise region detection configuration and providing accurate detection range definitions for algorithm tasks</li>
  <li><strong>Intelligent Linked Alert Mechanism</strong>: Supports a triple-link mechanism between detection regions, defense time periods, and event alerts. The system intelligently determines whether a detected event simultaneously meets the specified detection region range, falls within the defense time period, and matches the alert event type. Alerts are only triggered when all three conditions are met, achieving precise spatiotemporal condition filtering, significantly reducing false positive rates, and improving the accuracy and practicality of the alert system</li>
  <li><strong>Large-Scale Camera Management</strong>: Supports access to hundreds of cameras, providing end-to-end services including collection, annotation, training, inference, export, analysis, alerting, recording, storage, and deployment</li>
  <li><strong>Algorithm Task Management</strong>: Supports creation and management of two types of algorithm tasks, each task can flexibly bind frame extractors and sorters to achieve precise video frame extraction and result sorting
    <ul style="margin: 5px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Real-Time Algorithm Tasks</strong>: Used for real-time video analysis, supporting RTSP/RTMP stream real-time processing with millisecond-level response capabilities, suitable for monitoring, security, and other real-time scenarios</li>
      <li><strong>Snapshot Algorithm Tasks</strong>: Used for snapshot image analysis, performing intelligent recognition and analysis on captured images, suitable for event backtracking, image retrieval, and other scenarios</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dataset Annotation and Multi-Format Dataset Management</strong>: Provides a visual image annotation workspace supporting rectangle and polygon labeling, category management, and progress tracking; fully supports flexible import and export of mainstream dataset formats including YOLO, COCO, and ImageFolder, with cloud platform dataset integration enabling one-click import and synchronized export of cloud-hosted datasets—seamlessly connecting data collection, annotation, training, and deployment across the full pipeline</li>
  <li><strong>Stream Forwarding</strong>: Supports direct viewing of camera real-time feeds without enabling AI analysis functionality. By creating stream forwarding tasks, multiple cameras can be batch-pushed, enabling synchronous viewing of multiple video streams to meet pure video monitoring scenario requirements</li>
  <li><strong>GPU Discovery, Load-Aware Allocation, and Multi-GPU Collaboration</strong>: The platform provides GPU resource discovery and intelligent scheduling: it detects the number of available GPUs and dynamically assigns video encode/decode and algorithm inference work across cards according to per-GPU load, running tasks in parallel where appropriate to raise multi-stream throughput and utilization while keeping the pipeline stable—coordinating frame processing and model inference in multi-GPU deployments</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Transport Selection and Resilient Stream Pull</strong>: On RTSP and similar pull paths, the system can evaluate URL/path and related signals to choose and switch transport-layer modes; camera pulls default to UDP for lower latency. When consecutive frames indicate gray screen, decode errors, or stream collapse (decode stall), RTSP reconnect and link recovery run automatically to limit prolonged artifacts or frozen video</li>
  <li><strong>Separate Viewing vs Algorithm Pipelines and Tiered Bitrates</strong>: Live preview and wall viewing are decoupled from algorithm analysis frame extraction in both data path and control policy, with two independent control planes. The viewing path uses about 6500 Kbps to prioritize sharp, smooth monitoring; the algorithm path uses about 3500 Kbps to balance detection quality with compute and bandwidth, avoiding analysis and viewing competing on one high-bitrate channel—so operators get clear, fluid video while analysis stays scalable</li>
  <li><strong>Model Service Cluster Inference</strong>: Supports distributed model inference service clusters, achieving intelligent load balancing, automatic failover, and high availability guarantees, significantly improving inference throughput and system stability</li>
  <li><strong>Defense Time Period Management</strong>: Supports two defense strategies: full defense mode and half defense mode, allowing flexible configuration of defense rules for different time periods, achieving precise time-based intelligent monitoring and alerting</li>

### 💡 Technical Philosophy

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
We believe no single programming language excels at everything, but through the deep integration of three programming languages, EasyAIoT leverages the strengths of each to build a powerful technical ecosystem.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
Java excels at building stable and reliable platform architectures but is not suitable for network programming and AI development; Python excels at network programming and AI algorithm development but has bottlenecks in high-performance task execution; C++ excels at high-performance task execution but is less suitable than the other two for platform development and AI programming. EasyAIoT adopts a tri-lingual mixed programming architecture, fully leveraging the strengths of each language to build an AIoT platform that's challenging to implement but extremely easy to use.

### 🤖 Zero-Shot Labeling Technology

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
Innovatively leveraging large models to construct a zero-shot labeling technical system (ideally completely eliminating manual labeling, achieving full automation of the labeling process), this technology generates initial data through large models and completes automatic labeling via prompt engineering. It then ensures data quality through optional human-machine collaborative verification, thereby training an initial small model. This small model, through continuous iteration and self-optimization, achieves co-evolution of labeling efficiency and model accuracy, ultimately driving continuous improvement in system performance.

### 🏗️ Project Architecture Features

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
EasyAIoT is not actually one project; it is seven distinct projects.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
What's the benefit? Suppose you are on a resource-constrained device (like an RK3588). You can extract and independently deploy just one of those projects. Therefore, while this project appears to be a cloud platform, it simultaneously functions as an edge platform.

## ☁️ EasyAIoT = AI + IoT = Cloud-Edge Integrated Solution

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin: 15px 0;">
Supports thousands of vertical scenarios with customizable AI models and algorithm development.

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 4px solid #3498db;">
<h3 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0;">Deep Integration Empowers Intelligent Vision for Everything</h3>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 10px 0;">
EasyAIoT constructs an efficient access and management network for IoT devices (especially massive cameras). We deeply integrate real-time streaming technology with cutting-edge AI to create a unified service core. This solution not only enables interoperability across heterogeneous devices but also deeply integrates HD video streams with powerful AI analytics engines, giving surveillance systems "intelligent eyes" – accurately enabling facial recognition, abnormal behavior analysis, risk personnel monitoring, and perimeter intrusion detection.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 10px 0;">
The platform supports two types of algorithm tasks: real-time algorithm tasks for real-time video analysis of RTSP/RTMP streams, providing millisecond-level response capabilities; snapshot algorithm tasks for intelligent analysis of captured images, supporting event backtracking and image retrieval. Through algorithm task management, flexible frame extraction and sorting strategies are achieved, with each task able to bind independent frame extractors and sorters. Combined with model service cluster inference capabilities, millisecond-level response and high availability are ensured. Additionally, two defense strategies are provided: full defense mode and half defense mode, allowing flexible configuration of monitoring rules for different time periods, achieving precise time-based intelligent monitoring and alerting.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 10px 0;">
In terms of IoT device management, EasyAIoT provides comprehensive device lifecycle management capabilities, supporting multiple IoT protocols (MQTT, TCP, HTTP) to achieve rapid device access, secure authentication, real-time monitoring, and intelligent control. Through the rule engine, intelligent data flow and processing of device data are realized, combined with AI capabilities for in-depth analysis of device data, achieving full-process automation from device access, data collection, intelligent analysis to decision execution, truly realizing interconnected everything and intelligent control of everything.
